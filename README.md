# OneLightJekyll

This is a fork of [mgyongyosi/OneDarkJekyll](https://github.com/mgyongyosi/OneDarkJekyll)'s, but using Atom's [one-light-syntax](https://github.com/atom/atom/tree/master/packages/one-light-syntax) instead. We use this in [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) as our main light theme.

## Usage

To generate the files as-is:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run gen
```

To generate other atom themes, replace the `colors.less` with the corresponding theme's `color.less`.
